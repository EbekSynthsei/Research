# Research
A game about discovery.
This is a personal project, in which I'm focusing on a solid code base foundation, to improve my Unity experience, so that the story, artwork and gameplay part will come down to an easy and "low - code" approach. 

At the moment 2 main elements are the core of the solution.
The first one is about Input Management, Scene Management and Player Animation and Mechanics.
The second part, is a Dialogue System that heavily relies on the Experimental Library for the Graph View provided by Unity.

Currently I'm developing also an Interactable System that will rely on the Scriptable Object, allowing for an approach that brings Actions and Events to a Drag and Drop mode.

The project has almost no documentation, but I'm currently trying to improve on this side.
A roadmap will also be provided in further commits.
